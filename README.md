# Expo app - Bare Workflow

> creation of project

```
expo init rnWithExpoBare
```

To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd rnWithExpoBare
- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use managed workflow if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web

� You can also open up the projects in the ios and android directories with their respective IDEs.
� expo-updates (​https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/packages/expo-updates/README.md​) has been installed in your project. Before you do a release build, you'll need to configure a few values in Expo.plist and AndroidManifest.xml in order for updates to work.
